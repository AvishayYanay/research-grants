We consider ourselves to be members and beneficiaries of many academic fields, and we hope that this program will help foster and support the research community in those fields.  For example, in the spirit of open source collaboration, we will work to ensure that all RFP results are released as open source under MIT license.  However, this program is an experiment, and as a result, we reserve legal rights for protection.  Please note that by submitting an application, you and your co-applicants agree to the Terms and Conditions of this program.

### Terms and Conditions
We reserve the right to change the terms and conditions, including canceling the program at any time without notice, and the decision as to whether or not to award funding is entirely at our discretion.  Please note that you are responsible for complying with taxes and you agree to provide us with enough information that we can comply with all relevant laws and regulations.  There may be additional legal restrictions on your ability to enter, and of course, your research and testing must not violate any law.
