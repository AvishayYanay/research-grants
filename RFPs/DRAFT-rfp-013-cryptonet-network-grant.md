# RFP-013: Cryptonet Network Grant

## Background
As part of Cryptonetâ€™s mission to improve the cryptographic building blocks for Web3 applications, we are very interested in funding research projects in the space, and creating collaborations across companies and academia.  If you are a researcher working in any of Web3-related cryptographic problems we encourage you to apply to one of our grants, and become part of CryptoNet extended community of researchers and collaborator.

A network grant is a mid-size funding instrument intended to stimulate research on cryptographic problems arising from Web3 applications, such as the ones listed below. We encourage applications that span the entire range of research projects: from theoretical foundational questions, to applied implementation and experimental efforts. 

CryptoNet will fund grants in the following areas: 

- SNARKs
- Vector Commitments
- Multiparty Computation
- Threshold Cryptography
- Decentralized and anonymous authentication
- Fully Homomorphic Encryption
- Security against Rational Adversaries
- Quantum Resistant Cryptography
- Proofs of Space

Funds can be used to support graduate students, the summer salaries of university faculty, travel to conferences and meetings, participation in summer schools and Web3 events, fellowships for graduate students and postdocs.
