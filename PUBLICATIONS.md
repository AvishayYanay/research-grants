# Co-authored Publication Support Policy

## Introduction

This policy covers peer-reviewed publications in reputable scientific or academic journals and conferences, (co-)authored by a PL employee (with a PL affiliation) and an external collaborator. It does not cover talks at non-scientific conferences (e.g. community events) or conference attendance not associated with a publication.

For a publication authored by an external party to be covered under this policy, the following cumulative requirements have to be met:
  * At least one PL employee is a co-author of the publication
  * The publication acknowledges PL for the financial support (if support was only provided for the publication, a simple note suffices, e.g. "Protocol Labs provided financial support for presenting this conference paper")
  * In the case of conferences, the PL logo is included in the slide deck and displayed similarly to any other affiliation logos
  * In the case of conferences, only one external collaborator per publication can receive attendance support

## Open access

Access to research results is a pressing issue in the scientific publishing world. Many conventional publishers require assignment of copyright over the content of submitted papers and restrict their sharing, preventing researchers without subscriptions and the general public from reading and using the research results unless they are willing to pay (often) significant fees.

We believe it is important that all our research is accessible to the public. As such, for a conference publication to be covered by this policy, its publication venue must, at the very least, allow the authors to archive the pre-print and post-print versions on their personal or institutional website.

Ideally, though, we prefer all our research to be published in fully open-access venues that require no copyright transfer and impose no unreasonable sharing or re-use restrictions. It is, therefore, our goal to comply with the [Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/) principles for both internal and funded research. Publications in journals listed in the [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/) and having a pure Gold OA model (i.e. articles are available online immediately and without restrictions) are automatically eligible for support under this policy.

Publication in Diamond/Platinum OA venues, requiring no payments by either authors or readers, is encouraged. Hybrid venues, which charge both publication and subscription charges, are explicitly excluded.

Chapters in books listed in [DOAB](https://www.doabooks.org/) are covered under the same guidelines as journal articles.

## Language editing

We provide a no-charge paper editing service to co-authored publications. Papers may be submitted for review and editing prior to initial submission, prior to camera-ready submission, or both. Preprints and technical reports will also be reviewed on request.

## Financial support

### Conference attendance

When an eligible paper is being presented at a conference, we will sponsor attendance for up to one external co-author. Attendance expenses include conference registration fees and reasonable travel expenses complying with the PL Travel Policy. Any reimbursable expenses incurred by external collaborators require prior approval from Research.

## Journal publication fees

We will cover the publication fees (also referred to as Article Processing Charges) for articles authored or co-authored by a PL employee and published in journals listed in the DOAJ (or equivalent). The fees are limited to $2500 per publication.

## Requesting support

Please ask your PL co-author to submit a request if you'd like to make use of the support described above.
