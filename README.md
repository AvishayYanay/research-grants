## Bounties
Similar to a bug bounty program, we may occasionally post problems in this repository with an associated reward to be paid on delivery of a solution.  A list of active bounties may be found below

## RFPs and Grants
Requests for Proposals are a fairly common method for funding individuals and groups to solve problems.  In our case, we may have a list of self-contained problems that likely require a sufficiently large time commitment that funding will be often provided at intervals or checkpoints, rather than upon completion.  These would have the goal of funding researchers to develop or find novel results on these topics.  A list of active RFPs may be found below

Please check back regularly.  We are currently exploring the best legal and administrative framework to achieve our intended goals for this research program.
