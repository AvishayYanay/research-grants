# Protocol Labs Research - Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and Grants
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/team-research-0f41f4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/protocol/research)

This repository contains offers that Protocol Labs is making or has made to fund research in areas relevant to our core mission of improving the internet.  It is one of the structural research repository described in [research/README.md](https://github.com/protocol/research); please follow that link if you're interested in the organization of the research repositories.

Below is an exhaustive list of of the problems Protocol Labs currently intends to fund.  To submit a proposal for a current RFP, fill out and submit an application at our [RFP program page](https://grants.protocol.ai/). If you would like to submit a proposal addressing an unlisted problem, first open an issue in [protocol/research](https://github.com/protocol/research/issues), and follow the templateÂ to describe the problem you intend to solve.  The issue should stimulate discussion and verify that the problem is clearly defined, nontrivial, and important. Then proceed to the [RFP program page](https://grants.protocol.ai/) and apply for [RFP-0](https://grants.protocol.ai/prog/rfp-0). Naturally, following these steps does not guarantee that we will fund the proposal.

*Proposals are considered and awarded based on individual objectives. We may choose to fund all objectives within a proposal or limit our funding to those most relevant and promising. Please be clear when describing your proposal's objectives and how you plan to achieve them.*

## RFPs
Requests for Proposals are a fairly common method for funding individuals and groups to solve problems.  In our case, we may have a list of self-contained problems that likely require a sufficiently large time commitment that funding will be often provided at intervals or checkpoints, rather than upon completion.  These would have the goal of funding researchers to develop or find novel results on these topics.  RFPs are posted as issues in this repo, and a summary of active RFPs may be found below:

### ACTIVE:
  - **[RFP-9: Proof of Space and Useful Space](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-9-proof-of-space-and-useful-space.md)**

### INACTIVE:
  - **[RFP-1: Novel constructions for Proof-of-Replication](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-1-proof-of-replication.md)**
  - **[RFP-2: Novel constructions for Proof-of-Spacetime](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-2-proof-of-spacetime.md)**
  - **[RFP-3: Single Secret Leader Election](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-3-single-leader-election.md)**
  - **[RFP-4: Decentralised Access Control in CRDTs](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-4-CRDT-ACL.md)**
  - **[RFP-5: Optimize storage and convergence time in causal CmRDTs](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-5-optimized-CmRDT.md)**
  - **[RFP-6: Secret Single-Leader Election (SSLE)](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-6-SSLE.md)**
  - **[RFP-7: Multi-Level DHT Design and Evaluation](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-7-MLDHT.md)**
  - **[RFP-8: Scalability Bounds of P2P Pub/Sub (libp2p floodsub, gossipsub and episub)](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-8-pubsub.md)**

We may reopen inactive RFPs at a later date to encourage explorations of novel directions.
