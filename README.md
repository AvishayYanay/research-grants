# Protocol Labs - Research Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and Bounties
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/team-research-0f41f4.svg?style=flat-square)

This repository will contain offers that Protocol Labs is making or has made to fund research in areas relevant to our core mission of improving the internet.  It is one of the structural research repository described in [research/README.md](https://github.com/protocol/research); please follow that link if you're interested in the organization of the research repositories.

Below is an exhaustive list of of the problems Protocol Labs currently intends to fund.  To submit a proposal addressing an unlisted problem, first describe the problem you intend to solve in an issue in [protocol/research](https://github.com/protocol/research/issues), and follow the issue template.  The issue should stimulate discussion and verify that the problem is clearly defined, nontrivial, and important.  Then follow our [application guidelines](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFP-application-instructions.md) to submit your solution.  Naturally, even following these steps does not guarantee that we would fund the proposal.


# What's in This Repo?

This repo contains Requests For Proposals (RFPs) for the Grant program, which is elaborated below.

<!-- ## Bounties
Similar to a bug bounty program, we may occasionally post problems in this repository with an associated reward to be paid on delivery of a solution.  A list of active bounties may be found below

 - **(none at present, please check back later)**

## RFPs and Grants
Requests for Proposals are a fairly common method for funding individuals and groups to solve problems.  In our case, we may have a list of self-contained problems that likely require a sufficiently large time commitment that funding will be often provided at intervals or checkpoints, rather than upon completion.  These would have the goal of funding researchers to develop or find novel results on these topics.  RFPs are posted as issues in this repo, and a summary of active RFPs may be found below:

### ACTIVE: 
  - **[RFP-4: Decentralised Access Control in CRDTs](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-4-CRDT-ACL.md)**
  - **[RFP-5: Optimize storage and convergence time in causal CmRDTs](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-5-optimized-CmRDT.md)**
  - (more to be announced, please check back later)
 
### INACTIVE:
  - **[RFP-1: Novel constructions for Proof-of-Replication](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-1-proof-of-replication.md)**
  - **[RFP-2: Novel constructions for Proof-of-Spacetime](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-2-proof-of-spacetime.md)**
  - **[RFP-3: Single Secret Leader Election](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-3-single-leader-election.md)**
We may reopen inactive RFPs at a later date to encourage explorations of novel directions.
