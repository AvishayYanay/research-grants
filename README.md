## RFPs and Grants
Requests for Proposals are a fairly common method for funding individuals and groups to solve problems.  In our case, we may have a list of self-contained problems that likely require a sufficiently large time commitment that funding will be often provided at intervals or checkpoints, rather than upon completion.  These would have the goal of funding researchers to develop or find novel results on these topics.  RFPs are posted as issues in this repo, and a summary of active RFPs may be found below:

  - **[RFP-1: Novel constructions for Proof-of-Replication](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-1-proof-of-replication.md)**
  - **[RFP-2: Novel constructions for Proof-of-Spacetime](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-2-proof-of-spacetime.md)**
  - **[RFP-3: Single Secret Leader Election](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-3-single-leader-election.md)**
